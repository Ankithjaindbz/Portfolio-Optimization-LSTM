Advanced Stock Analysis and Portfolio Optimization
Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive suite of tools for stock analysis, forecasting, and portfolio optimization. It combines machine learning techniques, Monte Carlo simulations, and traditional financial metrics to provide insights into stock behavior and optimal portfolio construction.

Key Features
Stock Price Forecasting

Utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks for time series prediction
Implements feature engineering to enhance model performance
Employs Keras Tuner for hyperparameter optimization
Portfolio Optimization via Monte Carlo Simulation

Generates thousands of portfolio combinations
Calculates key metrics like Sharpe ratio, Value at Risk (VaR), and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
Identifies the optimal portfolio weights based on the highest Sharpe ratio
Portfolio Backtesting

Compares the optimized portfolio performance against the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)
Calculates various performance metrics including returns, volatility, alpha, and beta
Visualizes portfolio performance over time
